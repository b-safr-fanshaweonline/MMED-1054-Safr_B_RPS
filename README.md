MMED-1054-01-21W Virtual Rock Paper Scissors Game

Hey Tina,

I thought the while loop was a little unstable so I rewrote the game using a more functional method :)


## Virtual Rock Paper Scissors Game!

A virtual version of rock paper scissors! The player and compete by choosing an option and comparing their choices. The game is win, lose, or draw - the loser loses a life. Keep playing until one player has no lives left to live.
